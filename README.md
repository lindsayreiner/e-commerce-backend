# Description

This is a fully functional backend for an e-commerce websit. This includes a database of inventory with tables for category type, product, and tags. Interaction with the database of inventory is through Sequelize. All routes for viewing all the tables and their data, adding data to the tables, updating data to an existing item, and deleting an existing item have all been created.
